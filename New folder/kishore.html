        <p><h3>*Design and construction</h3>The Evolution of Luxury Cars: Design and Capability
 
            There is an undeniable allure to the beauty and design of luxury cars. These symbols of prestige and premium performance continue to capture the imagination of both automotive enthusiasts and casual drivers alike. Classic cars are bought and sold at incredible prices, vintage cars are painstakingly restored over years and luxury car collections are amassed by the world’s richest and most prominent individuals. Whilst most luxury cars have always embodied a fusion of opulence, grace and technological prowess, their style, look and mechanics have evolved over decades with a fascinating evolution from timeless sophistication to cutting-edge innovation. Luxury cars first started to appear in the 1900s as society expanded its perspective on transportation options and the demand for more sophisticated solutions grew. Pioneering manufacturers like Rolls Royce, Bugatti, Bentley and Daimler (which later became Mercedes) were amongst the first to display their expert craftsmanship and delivered custom-made vehicles that would provide a comfortable ride for the privileged few who could afford it. The luxury cars of this era were characterised by their attention to detail, with handcrafted interiors that utilised the finest materials such as leather, wood and polished metals. In the 1920s and 1930s, often referred to as the Golden Age of luxury cars, the designs became even more opulent with sumptuous detailing and powerful engines, all commissioned by owners who wanted their automobile to showcase their wealth and stature.
